# warp-perspective-test
quick warp-perspective keypoints test

make sure to edit the code according to the number of points you want to select:
- line 13: edit the pts2 s
- line 32: edit the if statement (if i == <number-of-points>)

make sure to double click for each point

*this is an ugly code and it's not scalable ik, will edit later
